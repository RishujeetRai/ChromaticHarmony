## Chromatic Harmony: Algorithmic Graph Coloring for Minimum Color Usage in Vertices

In this project, we create custom graphs, plot them, calculate the chromatic number for those graphs (indicating the minimum number of colors required to color each vertex/node such that no adjacent vertices share the same color), and then color the graph with the calculated number of colors to ensure no adjacent vertices/nodes have the same color.

### Key Features
- **Graph Creation** using the **networkx** library.
- **Visualization of Graphs** using the **matplotlib.pyplot** library.
- **Algorithm for Chromatic Number Calculation** to determine the minimum number of colors required.
- **Graph Coloring** based on the calculated chromatic number to ensure no adjacent vertices share the same color.
